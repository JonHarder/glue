* TODO Add opentelemetry support to the core run loop
   - metrics for:
	 - messages processed
	 - messages in =inBuffer=
	 - messages in =outBuffer=
   - tracing?
* TODO flesh out a library of out receivers and senders
   - receivers:
	 - endpoint poller (periodically hits an endpoint)
	 - endpoint server (exposes an endpoint to be hit)
	 - sftp
	 - local folder
   - senders:
	 - endpoint hitter (http)
	 - local folder: file
	 - sftp
	 - log
* TODO implement some sort of throttling
   - for senders? Exponential backoff if sends are failing
   - for receivers? Same deal
* TODO Scheduled receiver?
   - higher ordered receiver?
